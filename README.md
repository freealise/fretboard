# Freealise synth
Spectral additive synthesizer with microtonal keyboard optimized for touchscreen. 
Written in Javascript using Web Audio API, works in most browsers.

# Bugs
After the same key is pressed with two fingers, its sound mutes shortly after the start of note.

# TODO for beta:
Start over <br/>
Use WASM / Sunvox DLL (https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/jsplay/) <br/>
MIDI out (midi_out.js) <br/>
Touch radius / angle -> volume / pan <br/>
